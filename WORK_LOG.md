We got it working right away for the small test case but the numbers were still off for the other test cases. We then figured out that we should never be saving a value into the array that is larger than the smaller of i or j, so we put in another if statement to check for that. It didn't solve any of the test cases we had not already solved but it did get a bit closer in terms of what number we were returning compared to the actual value. |

I spent a good amount of time drawing out the cases on a whiteboard and going step by step with my code to debug which was pretty helpful. |
| February 27 |   9-10:45   | started out by working with kate at the board thinking about how to find all the possible substrings/the actual substring for the longest sequence. we were thinking about it in two main ways (still in the 2d array and then also with kates way of building onto the previous set of substrings), but then we ended up focusing on just the 2d array part. we looked for patterns that signified the actual cell we wanted to keep track of and tried to write a process to save it but then we thought about the instance in which there are multiple substrings with the same longest length and how we would differentiate between the different rows. then going into tutorial time I thought about it some more and wrote out some pseudocode of how to do that recursively, and the worked with cody and sierra on how to find and store all of the longest substrings. ultimately we decided that we would need some sort of memoized recursive method to deal with the time constraint and possibly a different data structure to deal with the space. |
