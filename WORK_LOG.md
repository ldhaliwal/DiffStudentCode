| February 15 | 11:15-11:55 |                                                                                              I brainstormed for a while at the boards with kate and we came up with a 2-d array tabulation approach. We got it working right away for the small test case but the numbers were still off for the other test cases. We then figured out that we should never be saving a value into the array that is larger than the smaller of i or j, so we put in another if statement to check for that. It didn't solve any of the test cases we had not already solved but it did get a bit closer in terms of what number we were returning compared to the actual value. |
| February 16 |   8-8:50    | Tried drawing out some of the cases and realized that i could just add 1 to the value of the cell diagonal up and to the left of the cell where theres a match in the characters. then i had to mess around to see how I would initialize the first row/col so that i didn't keep getting index out of bounds errors and then i tries making an extra row an column because the values would be initialized to zero and then I can jsut start representing the actual strings at index 1 and that worked pretty well! I spent a good amount of time drawing out the cases on a whiteboard and going step by step with my code to debug which was pretty helpful. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
